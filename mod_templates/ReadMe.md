This folder contains several sample XML files of a mod that can be used as a type provider
for fsharp.data. By having examples of all the modding types we want, the type provider can 
generate our type information in our fsharp code.

Most of the data in here will NOT make it in to the final mod. There are some exceptions.
Most of the time, we use the actual extracted game data as the XML type providers, but
in a few cases, there's no single xml file in the game data that provides us with the
types we need.
