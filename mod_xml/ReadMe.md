## After the Fall - An X4 mod of what happens once the Xenon have won.
The basic premise of the mod is that the various factions have been forced back to their home systems,
and the xenon have overrun the galaxy. Their economies are weakened, the Xenon are strong, and the 
only things keep the factions from being completely overrun is a series of defence stations right
on top of the gates.

We don't provide (yet) any gamestarts. That will be a future release. For now, given that this is really
aimed at experienced players that want a slightly tougher start, I recommend a custom creative start.
Details are below, in the gamestarts section.

## Compatibility
I've tried to keep the changes as tight in scope as possible to increase compatility with other mods.
Most should work fine, but in case you're wondering, check the following section on specific changes.
In general though, most of these changes are specific to galaxy initial creation; or increase the number
of ships the Xenon will build up to, or have at game start.

We don't make any logic changes, mission changes, add new ships, wares, etc.

Some missions might be very hard to complete though, given galaxy state!

## The Changes
1. Changed existing JOBs.
    * All ally factions have been updated so that they do NOT start with L and XL destroyers/carriers.
    Instead, they will slowly be built in their shipyards till they're at full strength.
    * Xenon: All ship numbers have been increased to almost twice as much. It's still a large galaxy,
    and the Xenon are now spread more thinly. So doubling jobs means some sectors can be a little sparse,
    but they xenon will have a lot of ships to throw at assaults.
    The Xenon economy has been boosted slightly (currently 30%). This means that the xenon can *sustain*
    a constant assault better than they could before; while faction economies are weaker and will find
    it harder to replace lost resources.

2. Moved defence stations, wharfs, shipyards, traders, etc.
    These have been moved to the new, smaller territories for the factions as listed below.
    Xenon defence stations and shipyards have been placed in these locations instead, flipping ownership
    to xenon.

3. Added some new resource fields to new faction home systems, as many of these systems had few, or no,
resources. It's a few small, moderately dense resource fields to keep the factions economies slowly moving,
but you'll need to help them get new territory.

4. Weakened faction economies by reducing the number of starting factories. They can expand to
build more, but at the start, they're  weakend, with a  stronger xenon.

5. Added 5 race-specific defence stations around each gate.
I tried to position them exactly in a ring around each gate; but the game moves them around on game start.
This means that some gates will have a very strong defensive line, others will have big gaps. Oh well.
Those factions might struggle a bit more then...

6. Lots of abandoned ships! 
We've scattered many new abandoned ships of various sizes around the galaxy, mostly in Xenon territory.
there are even some battlefields featureing many ships in a single location, from S to XL. Go exploring!
These locations are static for each version of the mod; but are randomly generated when I run the code
that generates the mod: so they may no be in the same place from mod version to mod version.

7. All changes are on GAME START only.

## Gamestarts: Custom Creative recommended
The galaxy starts off a bit rougher, with less safe sectors and weaker faction economies. This means
that your own growth may be slower - Without a strong economy, building stations or ships may take
a bit longer; and earning money to buy blueprints will be tougher.
With that in mind, I recommend you give yourself a bit of a headstart to avoid an early grind.
Exactly how much is up to you. I think it's still possible to do a zero-to-hero run, but I've not
playtested this.

I recommend setting several story starts to complete, as they will be harder to do now. Boron storyline
especially. 

If you want the playerr HQ, I recommend moving it to a safer location, because in the mod, Grand Exchange
can be dangerous, and deep in Xenon territory, far from safe sectors.

For starting locations, the existing unclaimed sectors still exist - you could set youself up an empire
in one of those, OR select one of the safe faction territories given below.

If you want a tough game, start in Grand Exchange, and go searching for safe space without looking at
the list below!

### Safe locations
For the most part, the 'home' cluster for the race is safe, and recommended you start in one of them.
Each faction will have two or 3 sectors, spread over one or two clusters. Some factions are back to
back with each other, and are thus a slightly safer and stronger start. Starting with one of those
factions locations would give more options for missions and trade, and an easier game.

#### Neutral sectors:
I've also cleared any factions & Xenon from some sectors to give players a few options to set up base, and give some factions a little bit of breathing room and protection for their trade from Xenon raids. Be warned - it won't take long for Xenon to expand in to these territories.

* Grand Exchange (all 3 sectors. Good starting location if you set up defences, but there is Xenon territory between you and other factions for trade)
* Family Zhin
* Wretched Skies X
* Oort Cloud
* Second Contact (right between Arg and Ant. If you claim this, you'll help Ant/Argt trade without being raided by Xenon.)
* Bright Promise (Between TEL and PAR. Claiming this helps protect PAR/TEL trade and makes these two stronger.)

#### Easier Starts:
Vigor and Riptide pirate factions: With all the xenon raiding parties, a scrap processing 
setup would do well!
    Avarice, and windfall sectors: They have lost no territory.

PIO and ANT
    They start next to each other in
    Segaris, Gaian prophecy, Brennans Triumph
    Antigone Memorial, The Void, Fronteirs Edge

Argon: Bundled with HAT in
    Argon Prime
    The Reach
    Morningstar III
    Hatikvahs choice


#### Harder starts

Teladi:
    They're slightly isolated in
    Ianumus Zura
    Thuraks Demise II & III


PAR:
    Trinity Sanctum III & VII
    Unholy Retribution

HOP:
    they've been forced back to a corner, with strong Xenon presense on their border.
    Cardinals Redress
    Lasting Vengence.
    Freedoms Reach

Zya:
    Far from anyone else, and surrounded by Xenon.
    Zyarth Dominion IV & X
    Eleventh Hour

Freesplit:
    Also far from help
    Tharka's Ravine XVI
    Heart of Acrimony II

Terran:
    Pushed back to Earth and Venus. They may have Asgards, but there's a strong Xenon presence in the solar system.
