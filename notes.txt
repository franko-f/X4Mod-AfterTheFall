If you wanted to add the new changeSet to the existing document, the way to do this would be to do something like this:
    doc.XElement.Add(changeSet.XElement)
    doc.XElement.Save("sample.xml")

Hello there!

I think I've found the answer to your problems.
Your mod may miss a minor detail like this Ralston one does, and that may be the reason to why god.xml may not work.

In order to ensure that god.xml spawns your stuff, all 'location' tags must include the matchextension="false" attribute!
I don't say that this is your problem with 100% probability, but this is highly probable, that this is the only problem.

So, instead of this:
<location class="sector" macro="homebrew_cluster08_sector001_macro"  />

Use this:
<location class="sector" macro="homebrew_cluster08_sector001_macro" matchextension="false"  />

This rule is also true for the jobs.xml, should you wish to add new jobs!
